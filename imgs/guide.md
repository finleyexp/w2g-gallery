NOTE: This is a stopgap measure for image hosting while gallery is built. Because, Facebook can and will use your pictures, but you certainly can't.

# Instructions
1. open github to w2g-gallery/imgs/
2. add image file(s) & save
3. open individual image, right click, select "copy link address"
4. paste link into address bar, enter, wait for image to upload, copy new address
5. open slider (in blogger), replace image href with new address
6. repeat for each image in the slider
